# Random Quote Generator: Teamtreehouse Techdegree, Project 01 //M Baker

Random quote generator that randomly selects an internal quote object and displays it to the page. Quote selection, background color, and text decoration are randomly generated. Quote updates after 30 seconds of user inactivity.

Adding more quotes requires only putting them into the quotes array in the appropriate object format: quotes[i].quote, quotes[i].source, quotes[i].citation, quotes[i].year, quotes[i].title.

All other values and functions are dynamic.
